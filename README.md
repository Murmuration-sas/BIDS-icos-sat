Correlation of satellite greenhouse gases data with European ICOS ground infrastructure

In addition to installing the libraries required by the jupyter, it is necessary to upload the oco2-xco2 dataset to GEE (Google Earth Engine). For this you can follow the repository: https://github.com/Murmuration-sas/oco2-jpl

Files: 
- Launch **Correlation_ICOS_EE.ipynb** in google colab for understanding the pipeline for only one station
- Launch **Correlation_ICOS_EE_CO2.ipynb** in google colab for launch and iterative process for each station
